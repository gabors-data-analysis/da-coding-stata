## Motivation

Nicholas Bohr once said funnily that "Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future." Nowadays most datasets have a time dimension and so analysts should face the challenges of using time series or panel data, and forecasting. So, all the analysts should know how to deal with time series (TS) data. 

## This lecture

This lecture introduces students to the basics of using time series data.

Case studies (at least partly) connected to this lecture:
  - [Chapter 12, 12.A1: Returns on a company stock and market returns](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch12a-returns-on-a-company-stock-and-market-returns)

This lecture uses the [SP500_2006_16_data.dta](https://osf.io/gds5t) dataset.

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing the code in `lecture12_TSdata.do` students should be able to:

  - Deal with date variables.
  - Define the TS structure of the dataset.
  - Fill gaps in TS data.
  - Use TS operators.
  - Execute some other important TS-specific commands.

## Datasets used

* [SP500_2006_16_data](https://osf.io/gds5t)

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **30 mins**.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 30 mins

Your task is to reproduce the following results of the case study: Electricity Consumption and Temperature:

  - Figure 12.7 on page 347.
  - Figure 12.8 on page 348.
  - Table 12.4 on page 353.
  - Table 12.5 on page 355.
  - Table 12.6 on page 358.

## Further material

  - The SSCC's online course has a comprehensive module on [working with dates](https://sscc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/stata_dates.htm).

  - The UCLA's online course also discusses the usage of dates in one of its [modules](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/modules/using-dates-in-stata/).

  - There is a [great list](https://www.stata.com/features/time-series/) on the Stata website about the opportunities of Stata in TS modeling.

  - Stata's [Time-Series Reference Manual](https://www.stata.com/manuals/ts.pdf) is about 1000 pages long and free of charge, and offers a comprehensive description of TS in Stata.
