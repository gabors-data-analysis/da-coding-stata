## Motivation

A book is often judged by its cover. Yes, having a nice content is important, but a fancy cover is important as well. Running a regression is not enough: you should be able to present its result in a way that is compact and easy to understand.

## This lecture

This lecture introduces students to the basics of presenting regression results. We mention some commands that help visualize the results, and we also discuss other commands that can be used to create compact and fancy tables containing regression results.

Case studies (at least partly) connected to this lecture:
  - [Chapter 10, 10.A1: Understanding the gender difference in earnings](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch10a-understanding-the-gender-difference-in-earnings)

This lecture uses the [morg-2014-emp.dta](https://osf.io/rtmga) dataset.

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing the code in `lecture11_presenting_regresults.do` students should be able to:

  - Visualize simple regressions and regression results.
  - Compile compact and fancy tables with regression results.

## Datasets used

* [morg-2014-emp.dta](https://osf.io/rtmga)

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **30mins**.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 20 mins

In your previous homework assignment you reproduced some regression results from chapters 9 and 10. Now, get back to those results, and try to arrange them into fancy and informative tables.

## Further material

  - Ben Jann, the creator of the coefplot command has a great [presentation material](https://www.stata.com/meeting/germany14/abstracts/materials/de14_jann.pdf) on it.

  - Ben Jann published an article in The Stata Journal about [estout](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X0500500302), and another one about [eststo](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X0700700207).

  - Roy Wada has a [paper](https://www.stata.com/meeting/wcsug07/Rapid_Formation_article.pdf) about the outreg2 command.

  - Asjad Naqvi has a long, but comprehensive [description](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/the-stata-to-latex-guide-6e7ed5622856) about producing LaTex-ready tables in Stata.
