## Motivation

A general wisdom is that a picture paints a thousand words, and it is even more true in data analysis. Graphing is essential in exploring our data, and also a powerful way of illustrating the results of an analysis, and conveying our message.

## This lecture

This lecture introduces students to the basics of making graphs. The opportunities of graphing in Stata are limitless, even the last tiny part of a graph can be changed. We show here only the basic logic.

Case studies (at least partly) connected to this lecture:
  - [Chapter 7, 7.A1 and 7.A2: Finding a good deal among hotels with simple regression](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch07a-finding-a-good-deal-among-hotels-with-simple-regression)

This lecture uses the [hotels-vienna.dta](https://osf.io/dn8je) dataset.

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing the code in `lecture07_graphs.do` students should be able to:

  - Understand the logic of graphing in Stata.
  - Create fancy graphs and do the scaffolding.

## Datasets used

* [hotels-vienna.dta](https://osf.io/dn8je)

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **40 mins**.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins

Your homework assignment is to reproduce Figure 8.9 on page 230 from the textbook.

  - Asjad Naqvi has a great [post](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/stata-graph-tips-for-academic-articles-8d962d5e8b75) on medium.com about graph tips for academic articles.

  - There are some interesting intro material on the Stata webpage that can function as starting points: [Visual overview for creating graphs](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/graphics/gph/stata-graphs/), [Publication-quality graphics](https://www.stata.com/features/publication-quality-graphics/), and [Graph styles](https://www.stata.com/features/overview/graph-styles/).

  - The World Bank has a nice DIME Wiki [page](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Stata_Coding_Practices:_Visualization) about visualization.

  - SSCC has an [intro module](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/4-24.htm) on visualizing, which unfortunately discusses the topic not with coding, but using the clicking method, although it is still helpful, as is offering an overview about the possibilities and the logic. 

  - Kevin Denny has a great [paper](https://www.ucd.ie/geary/static/publications/workingpapers/gearywp202102.pdf) about the basics of Stata graphs.

  - Stata Press has a [744-pages-long book](https://www.stata-press.com/manuals/graphics-reference-manual/) on graphing (online available and free of charge).

  - You should also check the two cheat sheets ([1](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/pdf/StataCheatSheet_visualization15_Plots_2016_June-REV.pdf) and [2](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/pdf/StataCheatSheet_visualization15_Syntax_2016_June-REV.pdf)) by the instructors of Geocenter.
